Sweet memories of my first crush:

We first met properly when I visited her father's shop for two days. We didn't have a proper conversation because we weren't well-acquainted with each other yet. That was the first time I saw her, and it felt like love at first sight. Since that day, I couldn't stop thinking about her; she became my sole life goal to achieve.

But I knew that this wouldn't last forever, because as you all know, one-sided love never succeeds. I felt like I was in a different world whenever I thought about her. She was so perfect—kind, elegant, gentle, beautiful—but it was all in my imagination, dreaming of a future with her. Things don't go as planned, as your thoughts. It hurts. It was painful not being able to approach her and tell her what I felt. I didn't have enough guts to speak out, but just thinking about her was a beautiful feeling. I used to be a guy who didn't believe in love; I used to think it was nonsense. But when I first fell for it, I experienced it, and now I understand what a heartbroken guy feels like.

Anyway, I knew I was being a bit crazy, pouring everything into this diary, but I think that's what falling in love is about.

I had already decided to move on because if I continued, my feelings would only grow stronger. When something bad happens, like her getting married (I know it will happen eventually), I would literally be destroyed. That's why I'm trying to move on, reminding myself that nothing can happen between us. But let's pray to God, maybe there's something in store for us.

We had a short conversation after that shop event.

05/04/2024:
I knew it was my birthday and obviously, I was waiting for her to wish me. Guess what? She wished me. All my waiting was over, but she messaged me "Happy birthday, bro." I mean, okay, "bro." But then I convinced myself that the most important thing was that she texted me first.

17/04/2024:
On this day, my mother told me that she needed a laptop for her college admission because her and my mother are very close friends. So my mother told her that the laptop wasn't available. I mean, what the hell? I was just trying to start a conversation with her, but you told her no, like I didn't say it in front of her, just in my mind. So on that day, I gathered the courage and texted her that if she wanted the laptop, she could take it. She texted back, and my heart was beating very fast. If someone had booed at me, I would have had a heart attack. She texted back in a very polite manner. She's so damn perfect. After one or two conversations, I just ended the conversation because I didn't want to make her feel like I was interested in her. So I just ended it, and then I thanked God for this opportunity.

31/05/2024:
This was the most unexpected day. I hadn't planned to have a conversation with her, but what happened was that I posted a snap of a book named "THE GIVER," even though I hadn't read it. I wrote the caption "BEST BOOK READ SO FAR." After some time, she texted me back with three replies, bro! That moment was surreal. I mean, I was just thinking about how I could talk to her, and here she was texting me back three times, bro! I waited half an hour just to digest the fact, and then when I opened her text, she wrote that she had already read that book and that it was the most boring book she had ever read. Yeah, I know, I became a joker here, but who cares? I got three replies from her, dude! Then we texted a few times, and then we ended the conversation, and again, I thanked God for this opportunity.

But I have to tell you something about my morning routine. Not just in the morning, but whenever I post a snap. Actually, I was more connected with her on Snapchat. That's why I was using Snapchat; otherwise, I would have uninstalled it much earlier. So what I used to do was check if she had seen my snap. When she did, I felt kind of relieved. I don't know why, but yes, I think my attraction to her was growing rapidly.

02/07/2024:
After that last conversation, we didn't have any conversation as such, and I continued to think about her at night. You know, 3 am thoughts. I was also kind of disturbed regarding my exams, career tension, and her. Also, I had been at home for so many months without any particular vacation, so I was kind of exhausted. In the afternoon of this day, my mother told me that she was coming to sleep with us because her father had gone out for business work, and her mother and brother had gone to Bangalore because her brother's college had started. So she was all alone at home, and she was coming to sleep with us. My happiness reached the sky because I hadn't seen her for months, and now she was coming to our house to sleep. Though I acted as if I was studying, I was all ready for her at the door of our house. She simply came and went directly to sleep, so I was concerned, but at least I had seen her, and the next day, early in the morning, she went back to her house. Again, I thanked God for that day.

03/07/2024:
For several days, my mother had been telling me that we could go out because my mood wasn't good. We could go to a movie, but I kept refusing. Then my mother said she was coming to sleep at our house again, and her father would come the next day. So I just couldn't stop thanking God for this. But I couldn't show any expression to my mother; my mother is so smart; she would know that I had some interest in her. So I didn't react much, and I said okay. Then I asked her if we could go to the movie today. So she said yes. Then she said that we could also ask her about the movie. When I heard that, I was crying and laughing inside. Then my mother asked her, and she said yes, so we went to the movie. My plan was not to watch the movie, I was going to sit next to her no matter what happened, and I sat happily next to her. She was so cute and sweet, making some expressions when watching some scenes from the movie, and I was just focusing on her instead of watching the movie. I was just trying to talk to her, and I was talking to her frequently. I was just continuously thanking God. When the movie ended, we went to the food court. But there was so much crowd in the closed restaurant, so we decided to go to a different restaurant. But there was no dine-in available. So we ordered the food and came home and ate it, and then we went to sleep. I was planning to talk to her more, but I thought my mother was also starting to notice that something was wrong. So I didn't start anything, and we all went to sleep. I was awake all night and posted a snap again, and she unexpectedly texted me back that she needed some kind of ointment for pain. I gave her the ointment, and she thanked me, and I kept thanking God for making these two days so special. I was just continuously thanking him, literally not stopping.

But I think back then, God was also giving some hints that I wouldn't have a future with her, so I came out of the fantasy and worked hard for my future. Yeah, then I also accepted it, and I knew from the start that I wouldn't have a future with her. She is also going to Bangalore for college. She will make good friends there, and who knows, she might also find a partner there. I wasn't very important in her life; I was just like a side character, you know? But I was living on that 0.001% hope that maybe something would happen. Who knows? And that's it for this time. I don't think I will see her often nowadays because of Moharram. Her whole family is going to Colombo, and then she also has her college in August, and she will move there. It hurts, bro, literally. I won't see her again, but I think this is life. Someone will come and go, but the right one stays. I'm just praying to God that she is the right one.
